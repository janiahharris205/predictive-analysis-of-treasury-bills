##abstract 
Artificial intelligence has given researchers access to a broader range of historical data, enabling the development of more accurate predictive models in finance. This study investigates the relationship between treasury bill rates and two high-demand commodities: gasoline and gold. We compiled a comprehensive dataset spanning ten years of historical prices: July 2014-July 2024, consisting of treasury bill rates, gasoline prices, gold-EPI, and natural gas consumption, and vital economic indicators such as GDP, inflation rates, and interest rates. Our analysis reveals that natural gas consumption exhibits the highest positive correlation (0.64) with treasury bill rates, while gasoline prices and the export price index of gold show moderate positive correlations (0.51 and 0.52, respectively). Training the data on a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network) and three deep learning models (Recurrent Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network and 3D Convolutional Neural Network). Their performance was assessed using mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R2score. The Recurrent Neural Network architecture was the most effective at capturing the relationships between the variables and treasury bill rates, achieving a root mean squared error of 0.08.
**Goal:** Predict Treasury bill rates using historical data using deep learning models. <br/> 
**Data range:** July 2014 - July 2024 <br/> 
**Models used:** Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, 3D Convolutional Neural Network, Reccurent Neural Network <br/> 
**Features:** Treasury bill rates, Interest rates, GDP, Natural gas consumption, Gold export price index, Gas prices, and Inflation rates <br/> 
**Real-World Impact:** This analysis demonstrates the potential for deep learning models to aid in financial forecasting and trading strategies by accurately predicting Treasury bill rates based on economic indicators.
